# In this problem the args are two arrays, num1 with variable m and num2 with variable n. Variable m gives an integer which denotes that you should use up to this number of elements in the array. Variable n gives the exact number of elements you should use in the array. The function should merge the final sorted array into nums1.

# merge([1,2,3,0,0,0], 3, [2,5,6], 3)
