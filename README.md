### Day 14: October 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed a coding challenge in python using pointers

**Thoughts**: It took me a while to wrap my head around the concept of using the pointers to solve the problem but I beginning to understand the importance of pointers and their creative usage.

### Day 15: October 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed challenge's using hash maps and pointers.

**Thoughts**: With some coding problems, learning equations and common algorithms and using them to come up with the solution before you even right code is very useful.
