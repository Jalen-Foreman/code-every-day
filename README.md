### Day 15: October 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed challenge's using hash maps and pointers.

**Thoughts**: With some coding problems, learning equations and common algorithms and using them to come up with the solution before you even right code is very useful.

### Day 16: October 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned a new way of slicing and combining lists in python

**Thoughts**: Looking at other solutions for a problem really gives me some better tools in my arsenal for other challenges to come.

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/Jalen-Foreman/code-every-day/blob/master/merge_sorted_array.py]

### Day 17: October 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: completed one challenge that implemented the use of pointers

**Thoughts**: It took me too long to think of a solution for the problem, with repition I will get better

### Day 18: October 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Haven't been logging my progress recently so these challenges are over a few days of challenges

**Thoughts**: I am beginning to learn the different ways data structures are sorted which is really important for algortihms

**Thoughts**: I know how to implement merge sort now!

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/Jalen-Foreman/code-every-day/blob/master/mergeSort.js]

### Day 20: October 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Just learned the implementation of quick sort. 

**Thoughts**: It's cool to realize how much recursion can improve the time complexitity of a function and once you understand it, it can greatly improve your coding ability.

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/Jalen-Foreman/code-every-day/blob/master/quickSort.js]

### Day 21: October 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Just learned the implementation of radix sort. 

**Thoughts**: I did 95% of the psuedocode by myself and the rest was articulated from the solution. Overall this implementation made me realized all the slick ways you can minimize how many lines of code you need to use.

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/Jalen-Foreman/code-every-day/blob/master/radix.js]

### Day 22: November 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: learned how to solve three sum in leet code.

**Thoughts**: I tryed to solve it myself but came to no avail. Eventually I will be able to solve lots of problems like this if I continue to solve coding challenges consistently

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/Jalen-Foreman/code-every-day/blob/master/three_sum.py]

### Day 23: November 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to use linked list as a data structure and there best use cases

**Thoughts**: Its actually pretty simple and kind of easy to pick up on since i've learned about it in the past

### Day 25: November 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Went over a crash course on swift because im going to be implementing its syntax soon

**Thoughts**: Learning new languages has become easier

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/Jalen-Foreman/code-every-day/blob/master/test.swift]

### Day 26: November 15-17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Was implemeting authentication on Swift App using AWS Amplify and AWS Cognito 

**Thoughts**: Learning Authentication was most definitely a challenge but through the help of Youtube I was able to implement them into the SwiftApp

### Day 28: November 19-21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Forgot to log my progress with the swift app but progress has been steady. Still trying to implement social sign in with AWS Amplify

**Thoughts**: I have to learn to be consistent but it's a learning process that I am going to overcome. Before you know it im going to look up and everything in life that I ever need or want is going to be right before me.

### Day 29: November 23-29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally learned how to implement the social sign in within the app. Was a long process but with dedication and hardwork, I was able to implement it into the swift app. It's still a work in progress but the SDK is setup.

**Thoughts**: Learning the concepts of the code rather than memorizing the syntax is better because it gives you an overall understanding of whats going on rather than this goes here and that goes there because of what you remember.

### Day 30: Decemeber 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on a website working on my css skills. I was working on it all week but never logged my progress.
